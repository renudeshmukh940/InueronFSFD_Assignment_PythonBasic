    "#### 1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "**Ans:** Functions reduce the need for duplicate code. This makes programs shorter, easier to read, and easier to update.\n",
    "     The main advantage of functions is code Reusability."

    "**Ans:** A function is procedure to achieve a particular result. while function call is using this function to achive that task. Using a function to do a particular task any point in program is called as function call. "

    "The purpose of the try clause is to enclose a block of code that might raise an exception. It allows you to specify the code that you want to monitor for potential exceptions. If an exception occurs within the try block, the execution of that block is immediately stopped, and the program flow is transferred to the corresponding except block.\n",

    "The purpose of the except clause is to define the code that should be executed when a specific exception occurs within the try block. It allows you to handle the exception and provide a way to recover from it or perform specific actions based on the type of the exception. You can have multiple except clauses to handle different types of exceptions or specify a more general exception type to catch any exception that is not handled by earlier except clauses.\n"
